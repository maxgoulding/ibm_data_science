In this project we are going to compare neighbourhoods between 2 different cities - New York, USA and London, UK\n\nIn New York there are 306 different neighbourhoods across 5 different boroughs. There are similarities between the neighbourhoods within each of these boroughs.\n\nIn particular, I want to be able to compare area from another city to decide which borough that area is most similar to. For example, is Toronto's Scarbourgh Village neighbourhood most similar to neighbourhoods found in the Bronx, Brooklyn, Manhatten, Queens or Staten Island boroughs in New York.\n\nAs I am from UK, I will be comparing area in London, UK to New York, USA."

However I currently know nothing about London or what it is like as a place to live. Before deciding where I would like to move to, I would like to first narrow down my options. \n\nEven though I don't know anything about London I know that I enjoy living in the Manhatten area of New York and would therefore like to know what areas of London are most similar to Manhatten by using available Foursquare API data. In addition, I'd also not like to be too far from my office near Kings Cross.\n\nWe first look at all areas of London to establish which New York boroughs they are most similar to. Then from the areas which are most similar to Manhatten, we will then establish how far from the new Google offices near King Cross they are to establish a shortlist of 3 areas I should consider living in when I moved to London."

A New York borough is larger than than a London borough.\n\nHowever, we can also that we can see by comparing average population sizes of a New York neighbourhoods and London boroughs they are not the same size as one another. In particular, a London borough has approximately 10 times the population of a New York Borough (~260,000 and ~27,000 respectively). A London Borough is larger than than a New York Borough.\n\nIn particular, it worth noting that a London Borough is somewhere in between the size of a New York neighbourhood and borough. Consequently, It will be crucial to normalise features to allow for fair comparison."

We also use the Foursquare API to establish the features of Boroughs in London. We will collect the types of venues within each borough.\n\nTo encode a venue list from the Foursquare API into features we will use one-hot encoding over the venues type in both London Boroughs and New York neighbourhoods, this will ensure features between the two data sets are the same (crucial for comparison later). \n\nAfter one-hot encoding, we then want to group by New York Neighbourhood and London Boroughs by taking the mean of the frequency of occurrence of each category, to normalise features. We can call this data our feature space (X)\n\nAt this point we should clearly label our New York Neighbourhood data for train and cross-validation data and London Borough data as test data (X_test).\n\nTo the New York Neighbourhood feautre data from Foursquare (X) we can add New York Borough labels which have been given an numerical encoding (y), as well splitting it into train (X_train, y_train) and cross-validation datasets (X_cv, y_cv)\n(stratified by Borough, 80% - train and 20% Cross Validation).\n\nI then to use the K-Nearest Neighbour Classification model on the New York Neighbourhood data with Borough label to train a Borough classification model.\n(i.e. given a Neighbourhoods features it should be able to classify what Borough it belongs to)\n\nWe will use the 20% cross-validation set from New York data to establish the best value for K (the number of nearest neighbours), by finding the best accuracy for a range of possible K values.\n\nI will then use the test data for London Boroughs to classify them according to what New York Boroughs they are most similar to.\n\nThen it simple to restrict data to London Boroughs most similar to Manhatten."
